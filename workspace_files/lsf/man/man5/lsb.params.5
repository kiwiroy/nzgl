\fBlsb.params\fR
.sp 2
   The lsb.params file defines general parameters used by the LSF
   system. This file contains only one section, named Parameters.
   mbatchd uses lsb.params for initialization. The file is
   optional. If not present, the LSF-defined defaults are
   assumed.
.sp 2
   Some of the parameters that can be defined in lsb.params
   control timing within the system. The default settings provide
   good throughput for long-running batch jobs while adding a
   minimum of processing overhead in the batch daemons.
.sp 2
   This file is installed by default in
   LSB_CONFDIR/\fIcluster_name\fR/configdir.
.sp 2
\fBChanging lsb.params configuration\fR
.sp 2
   After making any changes to lsb.params, run badmin reconfig to
   reconfigure mbatchd.
.sp 2

.sp 2
\fBParameters section\fR
.sp 2
   This section and all the keywords in this section are
   optional. If keywords are not present, the default values are
   assumed.
.sp 2
\fBParameters set at installation\fR
.sp 2
   The following parameter values are set at installation for the
   purpose of testing a new cluster:
.sp 2
   Begin Parameters
.sp 2
   DEFAULT_QUEUE  = normal   #default job queue name
.sp 2
   MBD_SLEEP_TIME = 20       #mbatchd scheduling interval (60 secs is default)
.sp 2
   SBD_SLEEP_TIME = 15       #sbatchd scheduling interval (30 secs is default)
.sp 2
   JOB_ACCEPT_INTERVAL = 1   #interval for any host to accept a job 
.sp 2
                             #(default is 1 (one-fold of MBD_SLEEP_TIME))
.sp 2
   End Parameters
.sp 2
   With this configuration, jobs submitted to the LSF system will
   be started on server hosts quickly. If this configuration is
   not suitable for your production use, you should either remove
   the parameters to take the default values, or adjust them as
   needed.
.sp 2
   For example, to avoid having jobs start when host load is
   high, increase \fBJOB_ACCEPT_INTERVAL\fR so that the job
   scheduling interval is longer to give hosts more time to
   adjust load indices after accepting jobs.
.sp 2
   In production use, you should define \fBDEFAULT_QUEUE\fR to
   the normal queue, \fBMBD_SLEEP_TIME\fR to 60 seconds (the
   default), and \fBSBD_SLEEP_TIME\fR to 30 seconds (the
   default).

\fBDescription\fR
.sp 2
   The name of the default job group.
.sp 2
   When you submit a job to LSF without explicitly specifying a
   job group, LSF associates the job with the specified job
   group. The \fBLSB_DEFAULT_JOBGROUP\fR environment variable
   overrrides the setting of \fBDEFAULT_JOBGROUP\fR. The bsub -g
   \fIjob_group_name\fR option overrides both
   \fBLSB_DEFAULT_JOBGROUP\fR and \fBDEFAULT_JOBGROUP\fR.
.sp 2
   Default job group specification supports macro substitution
   for project name (%p) and user name (%u). When you specify
   bsub -P \fIproject_name\fR, the value of %p is the specified
   project name. If you do not specify a project name at job
   submission, %p is the project name defined by setting the
   environment variable \fBLSB_DEFAULTPROJECT\fR, or the project
   name specified by \fBDEFAULT_PROJECT\fR in lsb.params. the
   default project name is default.
.sp 2
   For example, a default job group name specified by
   \fRDEFAULT_JOBGROUP=/canada/%p/%u\fR is expanded to the value
   for the LSF project name and the user name of the job
   submission user (for example, \fR/canada/projects/user1\fR).
.sp 2
   Job group names must follow this format:
.sp 2
     o  
         Job group names must start with a slash character (/).
         For example, \fRDEFAULT_JOBGROUP=/A/B/C\fR is correct,
         but \fRDEFAULT_JOBGROUP=A/B/C\fR is not correct.
.sp 2
     o  
         Job group names cannot end with a slash character (/).
         For example, \fRDEFAULT_JOBGROUP=/A/\fR is not correct.
.sp 2
     o  
         Job group names cannot contain more than one slash
         character (/) in a row. For example, job group names
         like \fRDEFAULT_JOBGROUP=/A//B\fR or
         \fRDEFAULT_JOBGROUP=A////B\fR are not correct.
.sp 2
     o  
         Job group names cannot contain spaces. For example,
         \fRDEFAULT_JOBGROUP=/A/B C/D\fR is not correct.
.sp 2
     o  
         Project names and user names used for macro substitution
         with %p and %u cannot start or end with slash character

.sp 2
     o  
         Project names and user names used for macro substitution

.sp 2
     o  
         Project names or user names containing slash character
         (/) will create separate job groups. For example, if the
         project name is \fRcanada/projects\fR,
         \fRDEFAULT_JOBGROUP=/%p\fR results in a job group
         hierarchy \fR/canada/projects\fR.

   The job ID limit. The job ID limit is the highest job ID that
   LSF will ever assign, and also the maximum number of jobs in
   the system.
.sp 2
   By default, LSF assigns job IDs up to 6 digits. This means
   that no more than 999999 jobs can be in the system at once.
.sp 2
   Specify any integer from 999999 to 2147483646 (for practical
   purposes, you can use any 10-digit integer less than this
   value).
.sp 2
   You cannot lower the job ID limit, but you can raise it to 10
   digits. This allows longer term job accounting and analysis,
   and means you can have more jobs in the system, and the job ID
   numbers will roll over less often.
.sp 2
   LSF assigns job IDs in sequence. When the job ID limit is
   reached, the count rolls over, so the next job submitted gets
   job ID "1". If the original job 1 remains in the system, LSF
   skips that number and assigns job ID "2", or the next
   available job ID. If you have so many jobs in the system that
   the low job IDs are still in use when the maximum job ID is
   assigned, jobs with sequential numbers could have totally
   different submission times.

   the mbatchd child query processes can run. Format the list as
   a white-space delimited list of CPU numbers.
.sp 2
   For example, if you specify
.sp 2

.sp 2
   the mbatchd child query processes will run only on CPU numbers
   1, 2, and 3 on the master host.
.sp 2 .SH "Description"
\fBDescription\fR
.sp 2
   This parameter allows you to specify the master host CPUs on
   which mbatchd child query processes can run (hard CPU
   affinity). This improves mbatchd scheduling and dispatch
   performance by binding query processes to specific CPUs so
   that higher priority mbatchd processes can run more
   efficiently.
.sp 2
   When you define this parameter, LSF runs mbatchd child query
   processes \fIonly\fR on the specified CPUs. The operating
   system can assign other processes to run on the same CPU;
   however, if utilization of the bound CPU is lower than
   utilization of the unbound CPUs.
.sp 2 .SH "Important"
\fBImportant\fR
.sp 2
   1. 
         You can specify CPU affinity only for master hosts that
         use one of the following operating systems:
.sp 2
           o  
               Linux 2.6 or higher
.sp 2
           o  
               Solaris 8 or higher
.sp 2
   2. 
         If failover to a master host candidate occurs, LSF
         maintains the hard CPU affinity, provided that the
         master host candidate has the same CPU configuration as
         the original master host. If the configuration differs,
         LSF ignores the CPU list and reverts to default
         behavior.

   By default, when EGO-enabled SLA scheduling is configured, EGO
   allocates an entire host to LSF, which uses its own MXJ
   definition to determine how many slots are available on the
   host. LSF gets its host allocation from EGO, and runs as many
   jobs as the LSF configured MXJ for that host dictates.
.sp 2
   \fBMBD_USE_EGO_MXJ\fR forces LSF to use the job slot maximum
   configured in the EGO consumer. This allows partial sharing of
   hosts (for example, a large SMP computer) among different
   consumers or workload managers. When \fBMBD_USE_EGO_MXJ\fR is
   set, LSF schedules jobs based on the number of slots allocated
   from EGO. For example, if \fRhostA\fR has 4 processors, but
   EGO allocates 2 slots to an EGO-enabled SLA consumer. LSF can
   schedule a maximum of 2 jobs from that SLA on \fRhostA\fR.

.sp 2
         The parameter \fBMC_PLUGIN_SCHEDULE_ENHANCE\fR was

.sp 2
   To significantly improve the performance of mbatchd for large

   If Y, mbatchd reserves resources based on job slots instead of
   per-host.
.sp 2
   By default, mbatchd only reserves resources for parallel jobs
   on a per-host basis. For example, by default, the command:
.sp 2
   bsub -n 4 -R "rusage[mem=500]" -q reservation my_job
.sp 2
   requires the job to reserve 500 MB on each host where the job
   runs.
.sp 2
   Some parallel jobs need to reserve resources based on job
   slots, rather than by host. In this example, if per-slot
   reservation is enabled by \fBRESOURCE_RESERVE_PER_SLOT\fR, the
   job \fRmy_job\fR must reserve 500 MB of memory for each job
   slot (4*500=2 GB) on the host in order to run.
.sp 2
   If \fBRESOURCE_RESERVE_PER_SLOT\fR is set, the following
   command reserves the resource \fRmy_resource\fR on all 4 job
   slots instead of only 1 on the host where the job runs:

\fBAutomatic time-based configuration\fR

   Variable configuration is used to automatically change LSF

   configuration changes in lsb.params by using if-else
   constructs and time expressions. After you change the files,
   reconfigure the cluster with the badmin reconfig command.
.sp 2
   The expressions are evaluated by LSF every 10 minutes based on
   mbatchd start time. When an expression evaluates true, LSF
   dynamically changes the configuration based on the associated
   configuration statements. Reconfiguration is done in real time
   without restarting mbatchd, providing continuous system
   availability.
