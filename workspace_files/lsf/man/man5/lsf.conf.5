.sp 2

.sp 2 .SH "About lsf.conf"
\fBAbout lsf.conf\fR
.sp 2
   lsf.conf is created during installation and records all the
   settings chosen when LSF was installed. The lsf.conf file
   dictates the location of the specific configuration files and
   operation of individual servers and applications.
.sp 2
   The lsf.conf file is used by LSF and applications built on top
   of it. For example, information in lsf.conf is used by LSF
   daemons and commands to locate other configuration files,
   executables, and network services. lsf.conf is updated, if
   necessary, when you upgrade to a new version.
.sp 2
   This file can also be expanded to include application-specific
   parameters.
.sp 2 .SH "Corresponding parameters in ego.conf"
\fBCorresponding parameters in ego.conf\fR
.sp 2
   When Platform EGO is enabled in LSF Version 7, you can
   configure some LSF parameters in lsf.conf that have
   corresponding Platform EGO parameter names in
   EGO_CONFDIR/ego.conf (LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.conf is a separate file
   from EGO_CONFDIR/ego.conf). If both the LSF and the EGO
   parameters are set in their respective files, the definition
   in ego.conf is used. You must continue to set LSF parameters
   only in lsf.conf.
.sp 2
   When EGO is enabled in the LSF cluster (LSF_ENABLE_EGO=Y), you
   also can set the following EGO parameters related to LIM, PIM,
   and ELIM in either lsf.conf or ego.conf:
.sp 2
     o  
         EGO_DISABLE_UNRESOLVABLE_HOST (dynamically added hosts
         only)
.sp 2
     o  
         EGO_ENABLE_AUTO_DAEMON_SHUTDOWN
.sp 2
     o  
         EGO_DAEMONS_CPUS

         EGO_PIM_SWAP_REPORT
.sp 2
     o  
         EGO_ESLIM_TIMEOUT
.sp 2
   If EGO is not enabled, you can set these parameters only in
   lsf.conf.
.sp 2
   See Administering Platform LSF for more information about
   configuring LSF for EGO. See the Platform EGO Reference for
   information about ego.conf parameters.

\fBChanging lsf.conf configuration\fR
.sp 2
   After making any changes to lsf.conf, run the following
   commands:
.sp 2
     o  
         lsadmin reconfig to reconfigure LIM
.sp 2
     o  
         badmin mbdrestart to restart mbatchd
.sp 2
   If you have installed LSF in a mixed cluster, you must make
   sure that lsf.conf parameters set on UNIX and Linux match any
   corresponding parameters in the local lsf.conf files on your
   Windows hosts.
.sp 2 .SH "Location"
\fBLocation\fR
.sp 2
   The default location of lsf.conf is in /conf. This default
   location can be overridden when necessary by either the
   environment variable LSF_ENVDIR or the command line option -d
   available to some of the applications.
.sp 2 .SH "Format"
\fBFormat\fR

   Each entry in lsf.conf has one of the following forms:
.sp 2

   NAME="STRING1 STRING2 ..."
.sp 2
   The equal sign \fR=\fR must follow each \fRNAME\fR even if no
   value follows and there should be no space beside the equal
   sign.
.sp 2
   A value that contains multiple strings separated by spaces
   must be enclosed in quotation marks.

.sp 2
   Specifies the logging level of error messages from LSF batch
   commands.
.sp 2
   To specify the logging level of error messages for LSF
   commands, use LSF_CMD_LOG_MASK. To specify the logging level
   of error messages for LSF daemons, use LSF_LOG_MASK.
.sp 2
   LSB_CMD_LOG_MASK sets the log level and is used in combination
   with LSB_DEBUG_CMD, which sets the log class for LSF batch
   commands. For example:
.sp 2
   LSB_CMD_LOG_MASK=LOG_DEBUG LSB_DEBUG_CMD="LC_TRACE LC_EXEC" 
.sp 2
   LSF commands log error messages in different levels so that
   you can choose to log all messages, or only log messages that
   are deemed critical. The level specified by LSB_CMD_LOG_MASK
   determines which messages are recorded and which are
   discarded. All messages logged at the specified level or
   higher are recorded, while lower level messages are discarded.
.sp 2
   For debugging purposes, the level LOG_DEBUG contains the
   fewest number of debugging messages and is used for basic
   debugging. The level LOG_DEBUG3 records all debugging
   messages, and can cause log files to grow very large; it is
   not often used. Most debugging is done at the level

.sp 2
   Running of post-execution commands upon restart of a

   running and allow the successful continuation of the job when

   The POST_EXEC may still run for a job rerun when the execution
   host loses contact with the master host due to network
   problems. In this case mbatchd assumes the job has failed and

.sp 2
   LSF sends electronic mail to users when their jobs complete or
   have errors, and to the LSF administrator in the case of
   critical errors in the LSF system. The default is to send mail
   to the user who submitted the job, on the host on which the
   daemon is running; this assumes that your electronic mail
   system forwards messages to a central mailbox.
.sp 2
   The LSB_MAILTO parameter changes the mailing address used by
   LSF. LSB_MAILTO is a format string that is used to build the
   mailing address.
.sp 2
   Common formats are:
.sp 2
     o  
         \fR!U\fR :  Mail is sent to the submitting user's
         account name on the local host. The substring \fR!U\fR,
         if found, is replaced with the user’s account name.
.sp 2
     o  
         \fR!U@company_name.com\fR :  Mail is sent to
         \fRuser@company_name.com\fR on the mail server. The mail
         server is specified by LSB_MAILSERVER.
.sp 2
     o  
         \fR!U@!H\fR :  Mail is sent
         to\fR\fR\fIuser\fR\fR@\fR\fIsubmission_hostname\fR. The
         substring \fR!H\fR is replaced with the name of the
         submission host. This format is valid on UNIX only. It
         is not supported on Windows.
.sp 2
   All other characters (including any other ‘\fR!\fR’) are
   copied exactly.
.sp 2
   If this parameter is modified, the LSF administrator must
   restart sbatchd on all hosts to retrieve the new value.
.sp 2
   Windows only: When a job exception occurs (for example, a job
   is overrun or underrun), an email is sent to the primary
   administrator set in the lsf.cluster.\fIcluster_name\fR file
   to the doman set in LSB_MAILTO. For example, if the primary
   administrator is lsfadmin and LSB_MAILTO=fred@company.com, an
   email is sent to lsfadmin@company.com. The email must be a
   valid Windows email account.

.sp 2
   When using MultiCluster, \fBLSB_QUERY_PORT\fR must be defined

.sp 2
   This parameter is recommended for busy clusters with many jobs
   and frequent query requests to increase mbatchd performance
   when you use the bjobs command.
.sp 2
   This may indirectly increase overall mbatchd performance.
.sp 2
   The port_number is the TCP/IP port number to be used by
   mbatchd to only service query requests from the LSF system.
   mbatchd checks the query port during initialization.
.sp 2
   If LSB_QUERY_PORT \fIis not\fR defined:
.sp 2
     o  
         mbatchd uses the port specified by LSB_MBD_PORT in
         lsf.conf, or, if LSB_MBD_PORT is not defined, looks into
         the system services database for port numbers to
         communicate with other hosts in the cluster.
.sp 2
     o  
         For each query request it receives, mbatchd forks one
         child mbatchd to service the request. Each child mbatchd
         processes one request and then exits.
.sp 2
   If LSB_QUERY_PORT is defined:
.sp 2
     o  
         mbatchd prepares this port for connection.The default
         behavior of mbatchd changes, a child mbatchd is forked,
         and the child mbatchd creates threads to process
         requests.
.sp 2
     o  
         mbatchd responds to requests by forking one child
         mbatchd. As soon as mbatchd has forked a child mbatchd,
         the child mbatchd takes over and listens on the port to
         process more query requests. For each request, the child
         mbatchd creates a thread to process it.
.sp 2
   The interval used by mbatchd for forking new child mbatchds is
   specified by the parameter MBD_REFRESH_TIME in lsb.params.
.sp 2
   The child mbatchd continues to listen to the port number
   specified by LSB_QUERY_PORT and creates threads to service
   requests until the job changes status, a new job is submitted,
   or the time specified in MBD_REFRESH_TIME in lsb.params has
   passed (see MBD_REFRESH_TIME in lsb.params for more details).
   When any of these happens, the parent mbatchd sends a message
   to the child mbatchd to exit.
.sp 2
   LSB_QUERY_PORT must be defined when NEWJOB_REFRESH=Y in
   lsb.params to enable a child mbatchd to get up to date
   information about new jobs from the parent mbatchd.

   This variable is rarely used but sometimes LSF does not
   properly change the directory to the user’s home directory

   attempting to automount the user’s home.
.sp 2
   When this parameter is not defined or set to AMFIRST, LSF,
   sets the user’s $HOME directory from the automount path. If it
   cannot do so, LSF sets the user’s $HOME directory from the
   passwd file.
.sp 2
   When this parameter is set to AMNEVER, LSF, never uses

.sp 2
   For UNIX-only clusters, privileged ports authentication
   (setuid) can be configured by commenting out or deleting the
   LSF_AUTH parameter. If you choose privileged ports
   authentication, LSF commands must be installed as setuid
   programs owned by root. If the commands are installed in an

   Comprehensive System Accounting facility (CSA).
.sp 2
   CSA writes an accounting record for each process in the pacct
   file, which is usually located in the /var/adm/acct/day
   directory. IRIX system administrators then use the csabuild
   command to organize and present the records on a job by job
   basis.
.sp 2
   When LSF_ENABLE_CSA is set, for each job run on the IRIX
   system, LSF writes an LSF-specific accounting record to CSA
   when the job starts, and when the job finishes. LSF daemon
   accounting in CSA starts and stops with the LSF daemon.
.sp 2
   To disable IRIX CSA accounting, remove LSF_ENABLE_CSA from
   lsf.conf.

.sp 2 .SH "Valid values"
\fBValid values\fR
.sp 2
   The following extension names are supported:
.sp 2
   CUMULATIVE_RUSAGE : When a parallel job script runs multiple
   commands, resource usage is collected for jobs in the job
   script, rather than being overwritten when each command is
   executed.
.sp 2
   DISP_RES_USAGE_LIMITS :  bjobs displays resource usage limits
   configured in the queue as well as job-level limits.
.sp 2
   LSB_HCLOSE_BY_RES :  If res is down, host is closed with a
   message
.sp 2
   Host is closed because RES is not available.
.sp 2
   The status of the closed host is closed_Adm. No new jobs are
   dispatched to this host, but currently running jobs are not
   suspended.
.sp 2
   RESERVE_BY_STARTTIME :   LSF selects the reservation that
   gives the job the earliest predicted start time.
.sp 2
   By default, if multiple host groups are available for
   reservation, LSF chooses the largest possible reservation
   based on number of slots.
.sp 2
   SHORT_EVENTFILE : Compresses long host name lists when event
   records are written to lsb.events and lsb.acct for large
   parallel jobs. The short host string has the format:
.sp 2
   number_of_hosts*real_host_name
.sp 2
      \fBTip: \fR
.sp 2
         When SHORT_EVENTFILE is enabled, older daemons and
         commands (pre-LSF Version 7) cannot recognize the
         lsb.acct and lsb.events file format.
.sp 2
   For example, if the original host list record is
.sp 2
   6 "hostA" "hostA" "hostA" "hostA" "hostB" "hostC"
.sp 2
   redundant host names are removed and the short host list
   record becomes
.sp 2
   3 "4*hostA" "hostB" "hostC"
.sp 2
   When LSF_HPC_EXTENSIONS="SHORT_EVENTFILE" is set, and LSF
   reads the host list from lsb.events or lsb.acct, the
   compressed host list is expanded into a normal host list.
.sp 2
   SHORT_EVENTFILE affects the following events and fields:
.sp 2
     o  
         JOB_START in lsb.events when a normal job is dispatched
.sp 2
           o

         JOB_CHUNK in lsb.events when a job is inserted into a
         job chunk
.sp 2
           o  
               numExHosts (%d)
.sp 2
           o  
               execHosts (%s)
.sp 2
     o  
         JOB_FORWARD in lsb.events when a job is forwarded to a
         MultiCluster leased host
.sp 2
           o  
               numReserHosts (%d)
.sp 2

               numExHosts (%d)
.sp 2
           o  
               execHosts (%s)
.sp 2
   SHORT_PIDLIST : Shortens the output from bjobs to omit all but
   the first process ID (PID) for a job. bjobs displays only the
   first ID and a count of the process group IDs (PGIDs) and
   process IDs for the job.
.sp 2
   Without SHORT_PIDLIST, bjobs -l displays all the PGIDs and
   PIDs for the job. With SHORT_PIDLIST set, bjobs -l displays a
   count of the PGIDS and PIDs.
.sp 2
   TASK_MEMLIMIT : Enables enforcement of a memory limit (bsub
   -M, bmod -M, or MEMLIMIT in lsb.queues) for individual tasks
   in a parallel job. If any parallel task exceeds the memory
   limit, LSF terminates the entire job.
.sp 2
   TASK_SWAPLIMIT:  Enables enforcement of a virtual memory
   (swap) limit (bsub -v, bmod -v, or SWAPLIMIT in lsb.queues)
   for individual tasks in a parallel job. If any parallel task
   exceeds the swap limit, LSF terminates the entire job.

         Pseudo-terminal: Do not use this parameter if your

         is because LSF must use a non-pseudo-terminal connection
         to separate \fRstderr\fR from \fRstdout\fR.
.sp 2
     o  
         Synchronization: Do not use this parameter if you depend
         on messages in \fRstderr\fR and \fRstdout\fR to be
         synchronized and jobs in your environment are
         continuously submitted. A continuous stream of messages
         causes \fRstderr\fR and \fRstdout\fR to not be
         synchronized. This can be emphasized with parallel jobs.
         This situation is similar to that of rsh.
.sp 2
     o  
         NIOS standard and debug messages: NIOS standard
         messages, and debug messages (when LSF_NIOS_DEBUG=1 in
         lsf.conf or as an environment variable) are written to
         \fRstderr\fR. NIOS standard messages are in the format
         \fR<<message>>\fR, which makes it easier to remove them
         if you wish. To redirect NIOS debug messages to a file,
         define LSF_CMD_LOGDIR in lsf.conf or as an environment
         variable.

   Multiple license files should be quoted and must be separated

   Multiple files may be kept in the same directory, but each one
   must reference a different license server. When checking out a

.sp 2 .SH "Description"
\fBDescription\fR
.sp 2
   Specifies the logging level of error messages for LSF daemons,
   except LIM, which is controlled by Platform EGO.
.sp 2
   For example:
.sp 2
   LSF_LOG_MASK=LOG_DEBUG
.sp 2
   If EGO is enabled in the LSF cluster, and EGO_LOG_MASK is not
   defined, LSF uses the value of LSF_LOG_MASK for LIM, PIM, and
   MELIM. EGO vemkd and pem components continue to use the EGO
   default values. If EGO_LOG_MASK is defined, and EGO is
   enabled, then EGO value is taken.
.sp 2
   To specify the logging level of error messages for LSF
   commands, use LSF_CMD_LOG_MASK. To specify the logging level
   of error messages for LSF batch commands, use
   LSB_CMD_LOG_MASK.
.sp 2
   On UNIX, this is similar to syslog. All messages logged at the
   specified level or higher are recorded; lower level messages
   are discarded. The LSF_LOG_MASK value can be any log priority
   symbol that is defined in syslog.h (see syslog).
.sp 2
   The log levels in order from highest to lowest are:
.sp 2
     o  
         LOG_EMERG
.sp 2
     o  
         LOG_ALERT
.sp 2
     o  
         LOG_CRIT
.sp 2
     o  
         LOG_ERR
.sp 2
     o  
         LOG_WARNING
.sp 2
     o  
         LOG_NOTICE

     o

     o  
         LOG_DEBUG
.sp 2
     o  
         LOG_DEBUG1
.sp 2
     o  
         LOG_DEBUG2
.sp 2
     o  
         LOG_DEBUG3
.sp 2
   The most important LSF log messages are at the LOG_ERR or
   LOG_WARNING level. Messages at the LOG_INFO and LOG_DEBUG
   level are only useful for debugging.
.sp 2
   Although message log level implements similar functionality to
   UNIX syslog, there is no dependency on UNIX syslog. It works
   even if messages are being logged to files instead of syslog.
.sp 2
   LSF logs error messages in different levels so that you can
   choose to log all messages, or only log messages that are
   deemed critical. The level specified by LSF_LOG_MASK
   determines which messages are recorded and which are
   discarded. All messages logged at the specified level or
   higher are recorded, while lower level messages are discarded.
.sp 2
   For debugging purposes, the level LOG_DEBUG contains the
   fewest number of debugging messages and is used for basic
   debugging. The level LOG_DEBUG3 records all debugging
   messages, and can cause log files to grow very large; it is
   not often used. Most debugging is done at the level
   LOG_DEBUG2.
.sp 2
   In versions earlier than LSF 4.0, you needed to restart the
   daemons after setting LSF_LOG_MASK in order for your changes
   to take effect.
.sp 2
   LSF 4.0 implements dynamic debugging, which means you do not
   need to restart the daemons after setting a debugging
   environment variable.

   When LSF_STRICT_RESREQ=Y, the resource requirement selection
   string must conform to the stricter resource requirement
   syntax described in Administering Platform LSF. The strict
   resource requirement syntax only applies to the select
   section. It does not apply to the other resource requirement
   sections (order, rusage, same, span, or cu).
.sp 2
   When LSF_STRICT_RESREQ=Y in lsf.conf, LSF rejects resource
   requirement strings where an rusage section contains a

\fBDescription\fR
.sp 2
   (Optional) If all of the hosts in your cluster can be reached
   using short host names, you can configure LSF to use the short
   host names by specifying the portion of the domain name to
   remove. If your hosts are in more than one domain or have more
   than one domain name, you can specify more than one domain
   suffix to remove, separated by a colon (:).
.sp 2
   For example, given this definition of LSF_STRIP_DOMAIN,
.sp 2
   LSF_STRIP_DOMAIN=.foo.com:.bar.com
.sp 2
   LSF accepts \fRhostA\fR, \fRhostA.foo.com\fR, and
   \fRhostA.bar.com\fR as names for host \fRhostA\fR, and uses
   the name \fRhostA\fR in all output. The leading period ‘.’ is
   required.
.sp 2
   Example:
.sp 2
   LSF_STRIP_DOMAIN=.platform.com:.generic.com
.sp 2
   In the above example, LSF accepts \fRhostA\fR,
   \fRhostA.platform.com\fR, and \fRhostA.generic.com\fR as names

.sp 2

   LSF_ULDB_DOMAIN specifies the name of the LSF domain in the

   input file.
.sp 2
   Used with IRIX User Limits Database (ULDB). Configures LSF so
   that jobs submitted to a host with the IRIX job limits option
   installed are subject to the job limits configured in the IRIX
   User Limits Database (ULDB).
.sp 2
   The ULDB contains job limit information that system
   administrators use to control access to a host on a per user
   basis. The job limits in the ULDB override the system default
   values for both job limits and process limits. When a ULDB
   domain is configured, the limits are enforced as IRIX job
   limits.
.sp 2
   If the ULDB domain specified in LSF_ULDB_DOMAIN is not valid
   or does not exist, LSF uses the limits defined in the domain
   named batch. If the batch domain does not exist, then the
   system default limits are set.
.sp 2
   When an LSF job is submitted, an IRIX job is created, and the
   job limits in the ULDB are applied.
.sp 2
   Next, LSF resource usage limits are enforced for the IRIX job
   under which the LSF job is running. LSF limits override the
   corresponding IRIX job limits. The ULDB limits are used for
   any LSF limits that are not defined. If the job reaches the
   IRIX job limits, the action defined in the IRIX system is
   used.
.sp 2
   IRIX job limits in the ULDB apply only to batch jobs.
