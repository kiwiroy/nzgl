.sp 2
   This is an administrative command. You must be logged on as
   root to issue this command.
.sp 2
   Prevents automatic startup of PERF daemons on a UNIX host when
   a system reboot command is issued. After this script/command
   is issued, PERF daemons no longer start automatically if the
   host gets rebooted. In such a case, you must manually start
   daemons after the host has started up.
.sp 2
   Removes the file perf created in the system startup directory
   by perfsetrc.sh.
.sp 2
   Run the command on the PERF host to control the following PERF
   services: loader controller (plc), job data transformer
   (jobdt), and data purger (purger). Run the command on the
   Derby database host to control the Derby database service
   (derbydb).
