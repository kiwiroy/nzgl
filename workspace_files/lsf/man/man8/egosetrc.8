.PP
Configures a UNIX host to allow automatic startup of Platform EGO on the 
machine when a system reboot command is issued. Creates Platform EGO links 
under the system startup directory.

.PP
This is an administrative command. You must be logged on as root to issue this 
command.

.PP
important:  

.PP
Before running this command, remove or rename EGO symbolic links under 
/etc/rc.d and /etc/init.d. 

.PP
For ease of administration, you should enable automatic startup. This starts 
Platform EGO automatically when the host restarts. After running egosetrc.sh, 
perform one of the following steps: 
.RS
.HP 3
o  
Restart the machine so that Platform EGO can start up automatically
.HP 3
o  
Run egosh ego start as root so that the cluster runs at the expected level

note:

.IP
If you run egosh ego start to start the cluster, note that the EGO service under 
/var/lock/subsys is not affected. As a result, any changes to the runlevel do not 
automatically affect system operations (for example, dropping from level 5 to level 2 does not 
automatically shut down the cluster) .

.RE

.PP
If you do not configure hosts to start automatically, Platform EGO must be started 
manually.
