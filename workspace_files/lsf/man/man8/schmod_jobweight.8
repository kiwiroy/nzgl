.SH NAME
\fBschmod_jobweight\fR - enables the LSF job weight policies

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP

.PP
When configured in lsb.modules, schmod_jobweight enables Cross-Queue Job 
Weight scheduler policies.

.PP
schmod_jobweight must be listed before schmod_cpuset and schmod_rms. and 
after all other scheduler plugin modules in the PluginModule section of 
lsb.modules.

.PP
You should not use job weight scheduling together with fairshare scheduling or job 
preemption. To avoid scheduling conflicts, you should comment out 
schmod_fairshare and schmod_preemption in lsb.modules.

.PP
Jobs from background queues will be scheduled only if NO job is pending on any 
foreground queue in the CURRENT SCHEDULING SESSION.

.PP
In some rare circumstances, you may observe that jobs from background queues 
are scheduled when there are pending jobs on foreground queues. This is because 
in that specific scheduling session, not all jobs are visible to scheduler depending 
on the submission time, mbatchd sleep time, etc. This is less likely to happen for 
long parallel jobs.
