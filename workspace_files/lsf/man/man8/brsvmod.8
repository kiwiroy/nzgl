.sp 2
      \fBCAUTION: \fR
.sp 2
         By default, this command can only be used by LSF
         administrators or root.
.sp 2
   Replaces advance reservation option values previously created,
   extends or reduces the reservation time window, or adds or
   removes reserved hosts of the advance reservation specified by
   \fIreservation_ID\fR. For a recurring reservation, can disable
   specified occurrences of the reservation.
.sp 2
   Administrators and root can modify any reservations. Users
   listed in the ResourceReservation section of lsb.resources,
   can only modify reservations they created themselves.
.sp 2
   The original value for user, user group, or time window, can
   be overridden with a new value by specifying the option as in
   brsvadd. Change a reservation from closed (the default) to
   open with the -o option, or from open to closed with the -on
   option.
.sp 2
   Options -n, -m, and -R must be used with the subcommands
   addhost or rmhost. These options allow adding or removing from
   the original values.
.sp 2
   The -td and -tn options are only allowed in disable
   subcommand.
.sp 2
   All three subcommands are mutually exclusive. The time window
   options -b, -e and -t are not valid in any of the subcommands.
.sp 2
   You cannot modify the start time of an active reservation.
.sp 2
   brsvmod does not support the
   \fR\fIreservation_ID\fR@\fIcluster_name\fR\fR notation for
   advance reservations on remote clusters, or the
   \fR\fIuser_name\fR@\fIcluster_name\fR\fR notation for
   reservations with remote users.
.sp 2
   The job slot requirements of the -n option must be satisfied,
   but -m or -R provides a candidate list for processing, which
   does not trigger error unless no valid hosts are the list. For
   instance, if you specify
.sp 2
   -n 3 -m "host1 host2"
.sp 2
   3 slots are required. LSF tries to find as many slots as
   possible from host1. If 3 slots are not available on host1,
   then LSF tries to find the rest from host2. Hosts with no
   slots available are removed from the list when the request is
   handled.

.br
               Adds hosts and slots on hosts into the original
               reservation allocation. The hosts can be local to
               the cluster or hosts leased from remote clusters.
.sp 2
               Adding a host without -n reserves all available
               slots on the host that are not already reserved by
               other reservations. You can specify the number of
               slots to be added from the host list specified
               with -n, but -n cannot be used alone. -m can be
               used alone if no host group is specified in the
               list. You cannot specify -R without with -n.
.sp 2
               The specified slot number must be less than or
               equal to the available number of slots for the
               hosts.
.sp 2
               Only hosts can be added (-m) to a system
               reservation. Slots cannot be added (-n) to a
               system reservation.

   [-f] \fIreservation_ID\fB\fR
.br
               Disables specified periods, or instances, of a
               recurring advance reservation. The
               \fIstart_date\fR and \fIend_date\fR represent the
               start and end date of a period in which the
               reservation should be disabled. These periods must
               take one of the following forms:
.sp 2
                 o  
                     yyyy:mm:dd-yyyy:mm:dd
.sp 2
                 o  
                     mm:dd-mm:dd - current year is assumed
.sp 2
                 o  
                     dd-dd - current month and year are assumed
.sp 2
               The start date must be the same as or earlier than
               the end date.
.sp 2
               If a reservation is disabled for a given day, then
               it does not become active on that day, and remains
               inactive for the duration of the reservation time
               window. Non-recurring reservations are able to use
               slots of the recurring reservation for the
               duration of the time window.The -tn option is a
               shortcut that disables a reservation on the
               starting day of the next instance of the
               reservation time window; that is, the instance
               that starts nearest in the future. If the
               reservation has already been disabled for this
               day, the modification request is rejected.
.sp 2
               For example, for a weekly reservation with time
               window from Wednesday 9 a.m. to Friday 10 p.m, if
               the current day is Monday, then running the
               command with the -tn option disables the
               reservation from Wednesday to Friday of the
               current week. However, if the current day is
               Thursday, then the reservation is disabled from
               Wednesday to Friday of the following week. If it
               is Wednesday, then whether to disable in the
               current week or following week depends on whether
               or not the start time of the instance has passed:
               if not then the reservation is disabled in the
               current week, otherwise the following weekâ€™s
               reservation is disabled.
.sp 2
               Running the disable command with the -tn option
               twice on Monday tries to disable twice in the
               current week. The second run has no effect, but is
               rejected because the specified reservation
               instance is already disabled.
.sp 2
               Once a reservation is disabled for a period, it
               cannot be enabled; that is, the disabled periods
               remain fixed. Before a reservation is disabled,
               you are prompted to confirm whether to continue
               disabling the reservation. Use the -f option to
               silently force the command to run without
               prompting for confirmation; for example, to allow
               for automating disabling reservations from a
               script.
.sp 2
   \fBrmhost [-n \fIjob_slots\fB] [-m "\fIhost_name\fB ... |
   \fIhost_group\fB ..."] \fIreservation_ID\fB\fR
.br
               Removes hosts or slots on hosts from the original
               reservation allocation. You must specify either -n
               or -m. Use -n to specify the number of slots to be
               released from reserved hosts. Removing a host
               without -n releases all reserved free slots on the
               host. The new slot specification must be less than
               or equal to the actual reserved slot number of the
               host.
.sp 2
               You can only remove a whole host from a system AR.
.sp 2
               How many slots or hosts can be removed depends on
               the number of slots that are free as long as the
               reservation is active. rmhost cannot remove more
               slots than are free on the host. This applies to
               removing hosts on both one-time and recurring
               reservations that are active. If you want to
               remove more slots from the reservation, you must
               wait until running jobs finish or the reservation
               is inactive.

               Changes a closed advance reservation to open, or

.sp 2
               Changes the type of a reservation to be open or
               closed. If the reservation is open, all jobs in
               the reservation become normal jobs, not subject to
               termination when the reservation window closes.
               -on closes the reservation when it expires.The
               running jobs of an open reservation are terminated
               when the reservation is changed into closed. The
               termination times of running jobs of a closed
               reservation are removed if the reservation is
               changed to open. The termination time of running
               jobs is set by mbatchd but checked by sbatchd.
               Termination time is an absolute time based on
               master host, so all hosts in the cluster should be
               synchronized with the local time on the master
               host. If sbatchd and mbatchd are not synchronized,
               termination may not occur at the correct time.

               Specify a time window one of the following ways:

.sp 2
               The default value for minute is 0 (on the hour);
               the default value for day is every day of the
               week.
.sp 2
               You must specify at least the hour. Day of the
               week and minute are optional. Both the start time
               and end time values must use the same syntax. If
               you do not specify a minute, LSF assumes the first
               minute of the hour (\fR:00\fR). If you do not
               specify a day, LSF assumes every day of the week.
               If you do specify the day, you must also specify
               the minute.
.sp 2
               LSF administrators can prevent running jobs from
               being killed when the reservation expires by
               changing the termination time of the job using the
               reservation (bmod -t) before the reservation
               window closes.
.sp 2
               When the job starts running, the run limit of the
               reservation is set to the minimum of the job run
               limit (if specified), the queue run limit (if
               specified), or the duration of the time window.

               reservation. Changing user does not affect the
               currently running jobs.
.sp 2
               Jobs submitted by the original user to the
               reservation still belong to the reservation and
               scheduled as advance reservation jobs, but newly
               submitted jobs from users that have been removed
               from the reservation cannot use the reservation
               any longer.
.sp 2
               The -u \fIuser_name\fR option does not support the
               @cluster notation for advance reservations on
               remote clusters.
