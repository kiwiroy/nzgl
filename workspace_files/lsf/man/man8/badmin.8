.sp 2
         This command can only be used by LSF administrators.
.sp 2
   badmin provides a set of subcommands to control and monitor
   LSF. If no subcommands are supplied for badmin, badmin prompts
   for a subcommand from standard input.
.sp 2
   Information about each subcommand is available through the
   help command.
.sp 2
   The badmin subcommands include privileged and non-privileged
   subcommands. Privileged subcommands can only be invoked by
   root or LSF administrators. Privileged subcommands are:
.sp 2
   reconfig
.sp 2
   mbdrestart
.sp 2
   qopen
.sp 2
   qclose
.sp 2
   qact
.sp 2
   qinact
.sp 2
   hopen
.sp 2
   hclose
.sp 2
   hrestart
.sp 2
   \fRhshutdown\fR
.sp 2
   hstartup
.sp 2
   hghostadd
.sp 2
   hghostdel
.sp 2
   diagnose
.sp 2
   The configuration file lsf.sudoers(5) must be set to use the
   privileged command hstartup by a non-root user.
.sp 2
   All other commands are non-privileged commands and can be
   invoked by any LSF user. If the privileged commands are to be
   executed by the LSF administrator, badmin must be installed,
   because it needs to send the request using a privileged port.
.sp 2
   For subcommands for which multiple hosts can be specified, do
   not enclose the host names in quotation marks.

   \fBckconfig [-v]\fR
.br
               Checks LSF configuration files located in the
               LSB_CONFDIR/cluster_name/configdir directory, and
               checks LSF_ENVDIR/lsf.licensescheduler.
.sp 2
               The LSB_CONFDIR variable is defined in lsf.conf
               (see lsf.conf(5)), which is in LSF_ENVDIR or /etc
               (if LSF_ENVDIR is not defined).
.sp 2
               By default, badmin ckconfig displays only the
               result of the configuration file check. If warning
               errors are found, badmin prompts you to display
               detailed messages.

.sp 2
               badmin diagnose 1057
.sp 2
   \fBreconfig [-v] [-f]\fR
.br
               Dynamically reconfigures LSF.
.sp 2
               Configuration files are checked for errors and the
               results displayed to stderr. If no errors are
               found in the configuration files, a
               reconfiguration request is sent to mbatchd and
               configuration files are reloaded.
.sp 2
               With this option, mbatchd is not restarted and
               lsb.events is not replayed. To restart mbatchd and
               replay lsb.events, use badmin mbdrestart.
.sp 2
               When you issue this command, mbatchd is available
               to service requests while reconfiguration files
               are reloaded. Configuration changes made since
               system boot or the last reconfiguration take
               effect.
.sp 2
               If warning errors are found, badmin prompts you to
               display detailed messages. If fatal errors are
               found, reconfiguration is not performed, and
               badmin exits.
.sp 2
               If you add a host to a queue or to a host group or
               compute unit, the new host is not recognized by
               jobs that were submitted before you reconfigured.
               If you want the new host to be recognized, you
               must use the command badmin mbdrestart.
.sp 2
               Resource requirements determined by the queue no
               longer apply to a running job after running badmin
               reconfig, For example, if you change the RES_REQ
               parameter in a queue and reconfigure the cluster,
               the previous queue-level resource requirements for
               running jobs are lost.

                           configuration files. Without this
                           option, the default is to display the
                           results of configuration file
                           checking. All messages from the

.sp 2
   \fBmbdrestart [-C \fIcomment\fB] [-v] [-f]\fR
.br
               Dynamically reconfigures LSF and restarts mbatchd
               and mbschd.
.sp 2
               Configuration files are checked for errors and the
               results printed to stderr. If no errors are found,
               configuration files are reloaded, mbatchd and
               mbschd are restarted, and events in lsb.events are
               replayed to recover the running state of the last
               mbatchd. While mbatchd restarts, it is unavailable
               to service requests.
.sp 2
               If warning errors are found, badmin prompts you to
               display detailed messages. If fatal errors are
               found, mbatchd and mbschd restart is not
               performed, and badmin exits.
.sp 2
               If lsb.events is large, or many jobs are running,
               restarting mbatchd can take several minutes. If
               you only need to reload the configuration files,
               use badmin reconfig.

               In a MultiCluster environment, badmin showconf
               only displays the parameters of daemons on the
               local cluster.
.sp 2
               Running badmin showconf from a master candidate
               host reaches all server hosts in the cluster.
               Running badmin showconf from a slave-only host may
               not be able to reach other slave-only hosts.
.sp 2
               badmin showconf only displays the values used by
               LSF.
.sp 2
               For example, if you define LSF_MASTER_LIST in
               lsf.conf, and EGO_MASTER_LIST in ego.conf, badmin
               showconf displays the value of EGO_MASTER_LIST.
.sp 2
               badmin showconf displays the value of
               EGO_MASTER_LIST from wherever it is defined. You
               can define either LSF_MASTER_LIST or
               EGO_MASTER_LIST in lsf.conf. LIM reads lsf.conf
               first, and ego.conf if EGO is enabled in the LSF
               cluster. The value of LSF_MASTER_LIST is displayed
               only if EGO_MASTER_LIST is not defined at all in
               ego.conf.
.sp 2
               For example, if EGO is enabled in the LSF cluster,
               and you define LSF_MASTER_LIST in lsf.conf, and
               EGO_MASTER_LIST in ego.conf, badmin showconf
               displays the value of EGO_MASTER_LIST in ego.conf.
.sp 2
               If EGO is disabled, ego.conf not loaded, so
               whatever is defined in lsf.conf is displayed.

               Collecting and recording performance metric data
