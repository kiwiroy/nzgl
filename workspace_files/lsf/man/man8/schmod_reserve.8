To enable processor reservation, backfill, and memory reservation for parallel jobs, 
you must configure both schmod_parallel and schmod_reserve in lsb.modules. 
If only schmod_reserve is configured, backfill and memory reservation are 
enabled only for sequential jobs, and processor reservation is not enabled.
schmod_reserve must come after schmod_parallel in the list of scheduler plugin modules in the PluginModule section of lsb.modules.
