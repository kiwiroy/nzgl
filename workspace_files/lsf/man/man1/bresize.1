\fBDescription\fR
.sp 2
   Use bresize release to explicitly release slots from a running
   job. When releasing slots from an allocation, a minimum of 1
   slot on the first execution host must be retained. Only hosts
   (and not host groups or compute units) can be released using
   bresize release.
.sp 2
   Use bresize cancel to cancel a pending allocation request for
   the specified job ID. The active pending allocation request is
   generated by LSF automatically for autoresizable jobs. If job
   does not have active pending request, the command fails with
   an error message.
.sp 2
   By default, only cluster administrators, queue administrators,
   root and the job owner are allowed to run bresize to change
   job allocations.
.sp 2
   User group administrators are allowed to run bresize to change
   the allocation of jobs within their user groups.

.br
               Optional. Cancel the active pending resource
               request when releasing slots from existing
               allocation. By default, the command only releases
               slots for jobs without pending requests.
.sp 2
   \fB-rnc \fIresize_notification_cmd\fB\fR
.br
               Optional. Specify the name of an executable to be
               invoked on the first execution host when the job
               allocation has been modified. This setting only
               applies to this release request, which overrides
               any notification command specified in bsub or an
               application profile. The resize notification
               command runs under the user account of job.

               Cancels the resize notification command at both

               Required. Defines the list of hosts to be

                           Specifies all the slots currently
                           being used by the job. If all is used
                           alone, it means release every slot
                           except one slot from the first
                           execution node. all can also be used
                           with a list of hosts to exclude with

                           Release the number of slots specified
                           by \fIpositive_integer\fR on the host
                           specified by \fIhost_name\fR. If the
                           number of slots is not specified, all
                           slots on specified host are released.

                           Specifies hosts to exclude when
                           releasing slots. Slots on the
                           specified hosts are not released. The
                           tilde (not) operator (~) must be used

.sp 2
   For a job that uses 8 slots across 4 nodes: 2 on hostA 2 on
   hostB, 2 on hostC, and 2 on hostD, the following command
   releases all slots except hostA. After releasing, the job
   allocation becomes 2 on hostA:
.sp 2
   bresize release "all ~hostA" 100
.sp 2
   The following command releases all slots except 1 slot from
   hostA. After releasing, the job allocation becomes 1 on hostA:
.sp 2
   bresize release all 100 or bresize release "all ~1*hostA" 100
.sp 2
   The following command releases one slot from each of four
   hosts. After releasing, the job allocation becomes 1 on hostA,
   1 on hostB, 1 on hostC, and 1 on hostD:
.sp 2
   bresize release "1*hostA 1*hostB 1*hostC 1*hostD"  100
