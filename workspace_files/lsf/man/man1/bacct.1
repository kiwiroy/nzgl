\fBDescription\fR
.sp 2
   Displays a summary of accounting statistics for all finished
   jobs (with a DONE or EXIT status) submitted by the user who
   invoked the command, on all hosts, projects, and queues in the
   LSF system. bacct displays statistics for all jobs logged in
   the current LSF accounting log file:
   LSB_SHAREDIR/\fIcluster_name\fR/logdir/lsb.acct.
.sp 2
   CPU time is not normalized.
.sp 2
   All times are in seconds.
.sp 2
   Statistics not reported by bacct but of interest to individual
   system administrators can be generated by directly using awk
   or perl to process the lsb.acct file.
.sp 2 .SH "Throughput calculation"
\fBThroughput calculation\fR
.sp 2
   The throughput (T) of the LSF system, certain hosts, or
   certain queues is calculated by the formula:
.sp 2
   T = N/(ET-BT)
.sp 2
   where:
.sp 2
     o  
         N is the total number of jobs for which accounting
         statistics are reported
.sp 2
     o  
         BT is the Start time :  when the first job was logged
.sp 2
     o  
         ET is the End time: when the last job was logged
.sp 2
   You can use the option -C \fItime0\fR,\fItime1\fR to specify
   the Start time as time0 and the End time as time1. In this
   way, you can examine throughput during a specific time period.
.sp 2
   Jobs involved in the throughput calculation are only those
   being logged (that is, with a DONE or EXIT status). Jobs that
   are running, suspended, or that have never been dispatched
   after submission are not considered, because they are still in
   the LSF system and not logged in lsb.acct.
.sp 2
   The total throughput of the LSF system can be calculated by
   specifying -u all without any of the -m, -q, -S, -D or\fI
   job_ID\fR options. The throughput of certain hosts can be
   calculated by specifying -u all without the -q, -S, -D or
   \fIjob_ID\fR options. The throughput of certain queues can be
   calculated by specifying -u all without the -m, -S, -D or
   job_ID options.
.sp 2
   bacct does not show local pending batch jobs killed using
   bkill -b. bacct shows MultiCluster jobs and local running jobs
   even if they are killed using bkill -b.

.sp 2
               If a default system service class is configured
               with ENABLE_DEFAULT_EGO_SLA in lsb.params but not

.sp 2
   \fB-U \fIreservation_id\fB ... | -U all\fR
.br
               Displays accounting statistics for the specified
               advance reservation IDs, or for all reservation
               IDs if the keyword all is specified.
.sp 2
               A list of reservation IDs must be separated by
               spaces and enclosed in quotation marks (") or (’).
.sp 2
               The -U option also displays historical information
               about reservation modifications.
.sp 2
               When combined with the -U option, -u is
               interpreted as the user name of the reservation
               creator. For example:
.sp 2
               bacct -U all -u user2
.sp 2
               shows all the advance reservations created by user
               \fRuser2\fR.
.sp 2
               Without the -u option, bacct -U shows all advance
               reservation information about jobs submitted by
               the user.
.sp 2
               In a MultiCluster environment, advance reservation
               information is only logged in the execution
               cluster, so bacct displays advance reservation
               information for local reservations only. You
               cannot see information about remote reservations.
               You cannot specify a remote reservation ID, and
               the keyword all only displays information about
               reservations in the local cluster.
.sp 2
   \fB-u \fIuser_name\fB ...|-u all\fR
.br
               Displays accounting statistics for jobs submitted
               by the specified users, or by all users if the
               keyword all is specified.
.sp 2
               If a list of users is specified, user names must
               be separated by spaces and enclosed in quotation
               marks (") or (’). You can specify both user names
               and user IDs in the list of users.
.sp 2
   \fB\fIjob_ID\fB ...\fR
.br
               Displays accounting statistics for jobs with the
