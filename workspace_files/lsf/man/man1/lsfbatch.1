.SH NAME
lsfbatch \- \s-1LSF\s0 Batch system
.SH DESCRIPTION
\s-1LSF\s0 Batch is a load sharing batch system that uses \s-1LSF\s0 Base 
and \s-1LSLIB\s0 to provide distributed batch job scheduling services.
It is supported by master and slave batch daemons that run on hosts
that act as servers of distributed batch jobs (see
.BR mbatchd (8)).
The Batch commands (each with its own man page) are as follows:
.TP 15
.BR bsub (1)
submit a job for batched execution.
.TP 15
.BR bmod (1)
modify the parameters of a submitted job.
.TP 15
.BR bjobs (1)
display the status and other information about batch jobs.
.TP 15
.BR bqueues (1)
display the status and other information about batch job queues.
.TP 15
.BR bhosts (1)
display the status and other information about Batch server hosts.
.TP 15
.BR bhpart (1)
display information about Batch host partitions.
.TP 15
.BR busers (1)
display information about Batch users.
.TP 15
.BR bugroup (1)
display the user group names and their memberships as defined in
the Batch system.
.TP 15
.BR bmgroup (1)
display the host group names and their memberships that are defined in
the Batch system.
.TP 15
.BR bparams (1)
display the information about the configurable system parameters of Batch.
.TP 15
.BR bpeek (1)
display the stdout and stderr output
produced so far by a batch job that is being executed.
.TP 15
.BR bhist (1)
display the processing history of batch jobs.
.TP 15
.BR bkill (1)
send a \s-1UNIX\s0
signal to batch jobs.
.TP 15
.BR bstop (1)
suspend batch jobs.
.TP 15
.BR bresume (1)
resume suspended batch jobs.
.TP 15
.BR bchkpnt (1)
checkpoint batch jobs.
.TP 15
.BR brestart (1)
restart a job from checkpoint its files.
.TP 15
.BR bmig (1)
migrate a job.
.TP 15
.BR bswitch (1)
switch pending jobs from one queue to another.
.TP 15
.BR btop (1)
move a pending job to the top (beginning) of its queue.
.TP 15
.BR bbot (1)
move a pending job to the bottom (end) of its queue.
.TP 15
.BR bacct (1)
generate accounting information about batch jobs.
.TP 15
.BR brun (1)
force a batch job to run.
.\".TP 15
.\".BR badmin (1)
.\"provide a set of sub-commands for \s-1LSF\s0 administrator to control the
.\"Batch system.
.PP
In addition to the native Batch command set described above, Batch also
supports \s-1NQS\s0 job submission, job inspection and control, and job script
files.
A Motif-based Graphical User Interface (\s-1GUI\s0), xlsbatch, is also
available, which supports all the operations listed above through an 
easy-to-use \s-1GUI\s0 interface (see
.BR xlsbatch (1)).
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Like other load sharing utilities, Batch needs access to the
.BR lsf.conf (5)
file to get information about the system configuration. By
default, all commands look to \fB/etc\fR to find
.BR lsf.conf (5),
unless the environment variable \fBLSF_ENVDIR\fR is defined. In this case
commands look to the \fBLSF_ENVDIR\fR directory to find
.BR lsf.conf (5).
It is required that all Batch
commands use the same \fBlsf.conf\fR file as the LSF daemons.
